# Gardiner'sSignList

Gardiner's Sign List is a list of common Egyptian hieroglyphs compiled by Sir Alan Gardiner.

It is considered a standard reference in the study of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. 

Gardiner's Sign List is fairly complete, and accepted by most Egyptologists.


Gardiner lists only the most common forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs, but he includes extensive subcategories, and also both vertical and horizontal forms for many hieroglyphs. 

He includes size-variation forms to aid with the reading of hieroglyphs in running blocks of text. Unfortunately he does not cross index signs, once put on the list, other significant uses may be overlooked. 

One example of this is G16, nbtá»‰, the ideogram for "The Two Ladies", goddesses Wadjet as cobra and Nekhbet as the white vulture. 

These are the protecting and patron goddesses of the separate Egyptian kingdoms that joined into Ancient Egypt, who were both then displayed on the uraeus of Wadjet when the unification occurred and afterward considered jointly to be the protectors of Egypt and the pharaohs. 

This ideogram is listed only on the bird list as G16, and overlooked on the deity list and the reptile list.
